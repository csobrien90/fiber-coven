                                <p>Emily O’Brien has been knitting since she was 12 years old. Emily went to school for theatre design but 
                                    ended up putting those design skills into knitwear instead! Emily focuses on creating patterns that are 
                                    not just beautiful finished objects but also really fun and addicting to knit. She has been featured in 
                                    Knit Picks Collections, Interweave, I Like Knitting, Knit Now, and has popular self-published patterns. 
                                    Emily lives in Louisville, KY with her husband Chad and a menagerie of 1 dog, 3 cats, 6 chickens, 1 rabbit, 
                                    and about 20,000 honeybees. Aside from yarn, Emily loves both kitties and cupcakes.</p>

                                <p>Lauren has been a knitter and crafter for 20+ years. She went to college for Clinical Nutrition at UC, 
                                    Davis and then became disillusioned with the medical profession.  Next, she went to culinary school and 
                                    cooked for several years until she became disillusioned with that profession too.  She is much happier 
                                    cooking yarn and fiber in her kitchen in her yarn-hovel in the mountains.  Valkyrie Fibers specializes in 
                                    self striping sock yarn and Lauren’s colorways are inspired by nature and pop culture.  In her free time, 
                                    Lauren likes yelling in the streets when human rights are infringed upon, (legally) smoking weed, and 
                                    petting kittens.

                                <p>A weekly witchy themed fiber arts podcast! We’re a coven of two yarn witches trying to craft fiber 
                                    magic through knitting, dyeing, spinning, and whatever we can get our witchy hands on. It’s a long 
                                    distance coven, so we thought we’d open it up to yarn witches across the globe so we can spread our 
                                    black magics far and wide. Lauren is the dyer behind Valkyrie Fibers and Emily designs knitting patterns 
                                    under the name Kitty With A Cupcake. New episodes drop on Tuesdays!</p>

                            <p>Inspired by fashions from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, this modular shawl is 
                                the perfect accessory for a hyperspace journey. The shape is a take on a triangle shawl but 
                                uses modular techniques to show off a self striping yarn and make the shape easier to wear. 
                                Grab a coordinating tonal, solid, or speckle yarn to pair with your self striping yarn and create 
                                an out of this world shawl. The shawl features a clean modern look that would be at home on any starship.
