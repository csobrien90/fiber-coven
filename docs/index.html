                    <h2>Emily</h2>
                    <p>Emily O’Brien has been knitting since she was 12 years old. Emily went to school for theatre design but 
                        ended up putting those design skills into knitwear instead! Emily focuses on creating patterns that are 
                        not just beautiful finished objects but also really fun and addicting to knit. She has been featured in 
                        Knit Picks Collections, Interweave, I Like Knitting, Knit Now, and has popular self-published patterns. 
                        Emily lives in Louisville, KY with her husband Chad and a menagerie of 1 dog, 3 cats, 6 chickens, 1 rabbit, 
                        and about 20,000 honeybees. Aside from yarn, Emily loves both kitties and cupcakes.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>A weekly witchy themed fiber arts podcast! We’re a coven of two yarn witches trying to craft fiber 
                        magic through knitting, dyeing, spinning, and whatever we can get our witchy hands on. It’s a long 
                        distance coven, so we thought we’d open it up to yarn witches across the globe so we can spread our 
                        black magics far and wide. Lauren is the dyer behind Valkyrie Fibers and Emily designs knitting patterns 
                        under the name Kitty With A Cupcake. New episodes drop on Tuesdays!</p>
